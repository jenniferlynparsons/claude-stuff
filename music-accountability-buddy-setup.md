Okay! I worked with Claude to write the custom instructions for this bot. (feel free to grab and modify them!) I created a new Project in Claude and added those instructions.
I also exported my Liked songs and a big playlist I call "Hit the Reset Button" that I use to influence the Spotify algorithm. I added those to the project knowledge in Claude so it knows what I like and what I already listen to. I may add some more playlists at some point to keep things fresh.
That's about it. I started up a new chat and the bot will cheerlead me when I tell it I finished a task. It handles creating and updating a CSV file that I'll be using to import a new playlist with another tool at the end of the day.
